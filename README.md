Challanges I faced: Well... everything is the challange.
When I focus on one piece at a time, I am the perfect coder. But once I have to deal with other pieces overlapping, things get really challenging.
If you were to mark me on individual concepts alone, I would be an A+ student guarenteed. Putting the concepts together to form something completly new is a lot harder.
Oh, how I overcame those challanges: I didn't.
I pushed through them the best that I could with many long nights but at the end of the day, you can only do your best.
What I've learned from this project: Well, I've actually learned a quite a bit.
I've learned everything that I know now about Bootstrap, I learned that Bootstrap has its definite limits and I learned that a combonation of Bootstrap and css makes my website look way way better than css along.
